Develop REST weather forecast web-service.

Framework for that project: Flask, FastAPI, Django (choose 1) 
ORM: SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, Tortoise, Django ORM( choose 1). 

Your service should gather weather forecasts from an API (you can choose provider yourself). 
Functionality: 
1. Show the weather forecast for the selected period (in the future) and the region (selected by user). 
Format:
{
 “region”: string,
 “start_date”: date,
 “end_date”: date,
 “average_daytime_temperature”: decimal,
 “average_nighttime_temperature”: decimal,
 “average_humidity”: integer
}

2. Generate statistics for the month /year/week (in the past) for the selected region. The data must be stored in a database (PostgreSQL).
Format:
{
 “region”: string,
 “start_date”: date,
 “end_date”: date,
 “average_daytime_temperature”: decimal,
 “average_nighttime_temperature”: decimal,
 “average_humidity”: integer
}

You can make frontend for that task, but it’s not necessary (will be an advantage). 
You should test your code using pytest.

1. Create a public repository for your code
2. Create a basic README for your code. In the readme remember to add instructions how to start and test your code and write how long it took to create it

If some information about the task is not clear or is not provided, do it at your discretion.
We will assess your code performance, readability, reusability and resilience to errors.
